            <p>A urinary tract infection is a very common type of infection in your urinary system. It can involve any part of your urinary system. Bacteria — especially E. coli — are the most common cause of UTIs. Symptoms include needing to pee often, pain while peeing and pain in your side or lower back. Antibiotics can treat most UTIs.</p>
            <p>This type of infection can involve your:</p>
              <p>Urethra (urethritis).<br>
              Kidneys (pyelonephritis).<br>
              Bladder (cystitis).</p>
              <p>Urine (pee) is a byproduct of your blood-filtering system, which your kidneys perform. Your kidneys create pee when they remove waste products and excess water from your blood. Pee usually moves through your urinary system without any contamination. However, bacteria can get into your urinary system, which can cause UTIs</p>
            <p>Also, Sexually transmitted infections can lead to sexually transmitted diseases. Treatment can depend on your diagnosis</p>
          </b>
        </p>

        <span style="line-height: auto;">  
          <p class="w3-text-red" style="font-size: 25px;"><b>DIFFERENT TYPES OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS</b></p>
            <img src="uti types.png" style="width:50%">
            <p>There are three different types of urinary tract infections. The type of infection depends on which part of the urinary tract is infected</p>
            <p>A urinary tract infection may involve different sections of the urinary tract including the following:</p>
            <p><b>Urethritis</b>: An infection of the urethra, the hollow tube that drains urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.</p>
            <p><b>Cystitis</b> A bacterial infection in the bladder that often has moved up from the urethra.</p>
            <p><b>Pyelonephritis</b> An infection of the kidneys that is usually a result of an infection that has spread up the tract, or from an obstruction in the urinary tract. An obstruction in the urinary tract causes urine to back flow into the ureters and kidneys.</p>
        </span>

        <span style="line-height: auto;">  
          <p class="w3-text-dark-green w3-hover-text-lime" style="font-size: 25px;"><b>UTI vs. STI: Which One Is It?</b></p>
            <img src="uti vs std.png" style="width:50%">
            <p>UTIs and STIs both cause painful urination, but their other symptoms differ</p>
            <p>Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are primarily spread through sexual contact, while urinary tract infections (UTIs) are usually contracted from bacteria passed on through the urinary tract. Both types of infections can have similar symptoms, but treatments and complications for a UTI vs. STI might differs.</p>
            
            <p class="w3-text-blue w3-hover-text-teal" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>What is a UTI?</b></p>
            <p><b>Urinary tract infections</b>happen when bacteria enter the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the vulva or penis. UTIs can happen to anyone, including children, and they are not STIs. However, having sex increases your risk for UTIs, particularly for people with vaginas.</p>
            <p>UTIs can affect the bladder or the kidneys. UTIs that affect the kidneys are typically more serious than those affecting the bladder.</p>
            
            <p class="w3-text-blue w3-hover-text-teal" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Symptoms of a UTI</b></p>
            <p>The symptoms of a UTI are the same regardless of sex. They include:</p>
            <p>- Pain or burning during urination<br>
              - More frequent urination<br>
              - Foul-smelling urine<br>
              - Feeling the urge to urinate even when your bladder is empty<br>
              - Bloody urine<br>
              - Pressure and cramping in the groin or abdomen</p>

            <p>Sometimes, a UTI can travel from the bladder to the kidneys. If you develop a kidney infection, you may experience:</p>
            <p>- Fever and chills<br>
              - Nausea and vomiting<br>
              - Pain in the lower back and sides</p>
            
            <p class="w3-text-blue w3-hover-text-teal" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>What Are Risk Factors of UTIs?</b></p>
            <p>Some people are at higher risk of getting a UTI. UTIs are more common in females because their urethras are shorter and closer to the rectum. This makes it easier for bacteria to enter the urinary tract. Other factors that can increase the risk of UTIs:</p>
            <p>
              - A Previous UTI<br>
              - Sexual activity<br>
              - Changes in the bacteria that live inside the vagina, or vaginal flora. For example, menopause or the use of spermicides can cause these bacterial changes.<br>
              - Pregnancy<br>
              - Age (older adults and young children are more likely to get UTIs)<br>
              - Structural problems in the urinary tract, such as enlarged prostate<br>
              - Poor hygiene, for example, in children who are potty-training
            </p>

            <p class="w3-text-blue w3-hover-text-teal" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>What is an STI?</b></p>
            <p>STIs are infections that are passed from one person to another during sexual contact, including oral, vaginal, and anal sex. Some STIs can also be passed through close touching and skin-to-skin contact. Viruses, bacteria, or parasites can cause STIs.</p>
            <p>The most common STIs include:</p>
            <p>
              - Human papillomavirus (HPV)<br>
              - Herpes simplex virus<br>
              - Trichomoniasis<br>
              - Chlamydia<br>
              - Gonnorhea<br>
              - HIV</p>
            <p class="w3-text-blue w3-hover-text-teal" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Symptoms of an STI</b></p>
            <p>Frequent or painful urination is a common symptom of STIs. However, other STI symptoms can differ depending on anatomy. It’s also common to have an STI that has no symptoms at all.</p>
            <p>The common symptoms of STIs in people with a penis are:</p>
            <p>
              - Burning or itching on or around the penis<br>
              - Dripping or discharge from the penis<br>
              - Sores, bumps, and blisters on the penis, anus, or mouth<br>
              - Pelvis pain<br>
              - Pain during bowel movements</p>
            <p>The common symptoms of STIs in people with a vagina are:</p>
            <p>
              - Burning or pain when urinating<br>
              - Urinating more often<br>
              - Pain or itchiness in the vagina<br>
              - Abnormal discharge, bleeding, or odor from the vagina<br>
              - Pain during sex<br>
              - Sores, bumps, or blisters around the vulva, vagina, anus, or mouth<br>
              - Pelvic pain</p>

          <p class="w3-text-dark-green w3-hover-text-lime" style="font-size: 25px;"><b>5 Common Myth About STDs</b></p>
          <p class="w3-text-blue w3-hover-text-teal" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Myth #1: STDs Go Away on Their Own</b></p>
          <p>Many People mistakenly believe STDs aren't serious and will go away in time. In reality, untreated STDs can cause serious and even permanent damage to your reproductive organs. This leads to issues with infertility and other long-term reproductive health complications.</p>

          <p class="w3-text-blue w3-hover-text-teal" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Myth #2: You Only Need STD Teasting If You Have A lot of Sex</b></p>
          <p>The truth is , It only takes one encouter with an infected person for you to become sick. Anyone you have sex with afterwards can also become infected and continue spreading the disease to others. Even if you use a condom, you should be tested regularly for STDs if you're sexually active.</p>

          <p class="w3-text-blue w3-hover-text-teal" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Myth #3: You Can Tell Who Has An STD:</b></p>
          <p>Herpes and other conditions can cause visible warts on genitals, but those signs aren't always present. Without testing, there is no other way you can tell who has an Infection. Before you start sexual relations with someone new, both of you should be tested. you should also get regular STD testing for as long as you're sexually active.</p>

          <p class="w3-text-blue w3-hover-text-teal" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Myth #4: You Can't Get Infected If You Birth Control:</b></p>
          <p>Condoms are the only form of birth control that can reduce your risk for getting an STD. You can still become infected if you have sex with an infected person regardless of what kind of birth control you take if yo have unprotected sex.</p>

          <p class="w3-text-blue w3-hover-text-teal" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Myth #5: You Can Only Get An STD Once:</b></p>
          <p>This particular myth can be especially dangerous. You can get many STDs multiple times and will require treatment for each occasion. Some viral infections, including herpes and HIV, remain in your body and cause recurrent health complications.</p>

          <p class="w3-text-blue w3-hover-text-teal" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Myth #1: Only Women can get Urinary Tract Infections:</b></p>
          <p><b>Truth:</b> UTIs can affect both men and women. Women are at greater risk for a UTI because the urethra is shorter thatn in men, so it's easier for bacteria to travel to the bladder. UTIs also are more common in postmenopausal women because low estrogen levels change vaginal and urethral tissue to increase the risk of infection.</p>

          <p class="w3-text-blue w3-hover-text-teal" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Myth #2: All UTIs Cause Symptoms:</b></p>
          <p><b>Truth:</b> Most UTIs cause symptoms, like pain ro burning when urinating; feeling like yo need to urinate often; or a burning sensation while urinating. However, it is possible to ahve bacteria in the urinary tract but not have any UTI symptoms. This is called asymptomatic bacteriuria, and it is more common in older adults or people who use a catheter to empty their bladders.</p>

          <p class="w3-text-blue w3-hover-text-teal" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Myth #3: All UTIs Must Be Treated With Antibiotics:</b></p>
          <p><b>Truth: </b>Not all UTIs require antibiotics. Some people can have bacteria in their bladders but not experience any symptoms. This is called asymptomatic bacteriuria. In most cases, no treatment is necessary as the bacteria is not causing issues. But there are a few groups of people that may require treatment, including people who are pregnant, people with planned urologic surgery and people with weakened immune systems.</p>

          <p class="w3-text-blue w3-hover-text-teal" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Myth #4: A UTIs Will Go Away On Its Own:</b></p>
          <p><b>Facts: </b>Asymptomatic bacteriuria, which is a UTI without symptoms, could go away without treatment. However, UTIs with symptoms rarely resolve on thier own. If you are experiencing UTI symptoms, like burning, pain or frequency, talk with your health care team about obtaining a urine culture and the right treatment for you.</p>

          <p class="w3-text-blue w3-hover-text-teal" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Myth #5: UTIs Can be Passed To Your Partner:</b></p>
          <p><b>Truth: </b>UTIs are not contagious or passed between partners by sexual or casual physical contact.</p>

          <p class="w3-text-blue w3-hover-text-teal" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Myth #6: UTIs Are Sexually Transmitted Infections:</b></p>
          <p><b>Facts: </b>Sexual activity can increase the risk for, but it does not casue a UTI. Therfore, UTIs are nto classified as sexually transmitted infections. The act of intercourse can cause bacteria to get close to or into the urethre, the small tube that empties your bladder. Lower your risk by urinating after intercourse to remove some of the bacteria before it can cause an infection.</p>

          <p class="w3-text-dark-green w3-hover-text-lime" style="font-size: 25px;"><b>How Can UTIs be Prevented?</b></p>
          <p>You can help prevent UTIs by doing the following:</p>
          <p>
            - Urinate after sexual activity.<br>
            - Stay well hydrated.<br>
            - Take Showers instead of baths.<br>
            - Minimize douching, sprays, or powders in the genital area.<br>
            - Teach girls when potty training to wipe front to back.

            <p><b>Staph</b> infections are caused by staphylococcus bacteria. These types of germs are commonly found on the skin or in the nose of many healthy people. Most of the time, these bacteria cause no problems or cause relatively minor skin infections.</p>
            <p>But Staph infections can turn deadly if the bacteria invade deeper into your body, entering your bloodstream, joints, bones, lungs or heart. A growing number of otherwise healthy people are developing life-threatening staph infections.</p>
            <p>Treatment usually involves antibiotics and cleaning of infected area. However, some staph infections no longer respond, or become resistant to common antibiotics.</p>
            <p>Research conducted by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in October 7, 2019 reveals that <b>staphylococcus and Other Stubborn infections can immediately end someone's life in a second.</b></p>
            <p class="w3-text-red w3-hover-text-teal" style="font-size: 22px;"><b>Here are some notable symptoms of staph</b></p>
            <p>Staph infections can range from minor skin problems to endocarditis, a life-threatening infection of the inner lining of your heart (endocardium). Because of this, signs and symptoms of staph infections vary widely, depending on the location and severity of the infection.</p>
          </p>

          <p class="w3-text-blue w3-hover-text-teal" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Skin Infections</b></p>

            <p>Skin Infections caused by staph bacteria include:</p>
            <p><b>Boil:</b> The most common type of staph infection is the boil, a pocket of pus that develops in a hair follicle or oil gland. The skin over the infected area usually becomes red and swollen. If a boil breaks open, it will probably drain pus. Boils occur most often under the arms or around the groin or buttocks.</p>
            <p><b>Impetigo: </b>This contagious, often painful rash can be caused by staph bacteria. Impetigo usually features large blisters that may ooze fluid and develop a honey-colored crust.</p>
            <p><b>Cellulitis: </b>Cellulitis - an infection of the deeper layers of skin - causes skin redness and swelling on the surface of your skin. Sores or areas of oozing discharge may develop, too.</p>
            <p><b>Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome: </b>Toxins produced as a results of a staph infection may lead to staphylococcal scalded skin sndrome. Affecting mostly babies and children, this condition features a fever, a rash and sometimes blisters. When the blisters break, the top layer of skin comes off - leaving a red, raw surface that looks like a burn.</p>

            <p>Staph bacteria are one of the most common causes of food poisoning. Symptoms come on quickly, usually within hours of eating a contaminated food. symptoms usually disappear quickly, too, often lasting just half a day.</p>
            <p>A Staph infection in food usually doesn't cause a fever. Signs and symptoms you can expect with this type of staph infection include:</p>

            <img src="syp1.png" width="50%"><img src="syp2.png" width="50%">
            <p><b>Syphilis </b>is a sexually transmitted disease with a notorious history. Caused by the bacterium Trepidation pallidum, it can lead to serious complications if left untreated. Syphilis is transmitted by direct contact with syphilis sores, which can appear on the external genitals and the mouth, as well as in the vagina or rectum. Because these sores can appear on areas not covered by condom, condoms only reduce the likelihood of transmission, but not eliminate it entirely. The small painless sores (Chancres) of early syphilis may heal by themselves, but that doesn't mean the disease is gone - it just become more difficult to detect and</p>
            <p>The disease affects your gnitals, skin and mucous membranes, but it can also involve many other parts of your body, including your brain and your heart.</p>
            <p>The signs and symptoms of syphilis may occur in three stages - Primaty, Ceconday, and tertiart. Some people also experience latent syphilis, in which blood tests are positive for the bacteria but no symptoms are present.</p>
            <p>At first, only a small, painless sore (chancre) may be present at the site of infection, usually the genitals, rectum, tongue or lips.</p>
            <p>As the disease worsens, symptoms may include:</p>
            <p>
              - Rash marked by red or reddish-brown, penny-sized sores over any area of your body, including your palms and soles<br>
              - Fever<br>
              - Enlarged lymph nodes<br>
              - Fatigue and a vague feeling of discomfort<br>
              - Soreness and aching.
            </p>
            <p>Without treatment, syphilis bacteria may spread, leading to serious internal organ damage and death years after the original infection.</p>
            <p>Some of the signs and symptoms of late-stage syphilis include:</p>
            <p>
              - Lack of coordination<br>
              - Numbness<br>
              - Paralysis<br>
              - Blindness<br>
              - Dementia
            </p>
            <p>There's also a condition known as <b>Congenital syphilis,</b> which occurs when a pregnant woman with syphilis passes the disease to her unborn infant. Congenital syphilis can be disabling, even life-threatening, so it's important for pregnant women with syphilis to be treated.</p>

              ... My Story transcended from sad to good; and from good to better even after using an expensive antibiotics which proved abortive. There is nothing, I meant nothing i haven't tried to combat this deadly infection... Indeed, there is nothing God can not do. Also, there's always a hope at the end of the tunnel.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am Stella Okafor from Anambra State, a mother of 3 wonderful kids and a teacher by profession. Year 2020 was a year I won't want to experience again for the rest of my life. My husband, Chris and I haven't experienced anything of such since we ever got married. It drained us - Emotionally, Physically, Spiritually and Financially. Apart from draining us, It taught us lots of lessons, I meant life lessons especially how human treats human all in the name of trying to provide solutions ot a prevailing problem... Anyway, that isn't the reason why I am telling you this. For more than a week, I had severe itching in my private part, irregular menstruation, and brown discharge.
            </p>
            <p>
              MY husband had his own share of this too. He got a white milky discharge form the tip of his manhood in the morning, something he thought was normal for more than a week. He also experienced pain when urinating, and always had a frequent urge to urinate regularly. In his word <i>'urinating now becomes something I get worried of, the last drop of urine makes me uncomfortable for more than 30 minutes'</i>. It came as a sudden shock to us becuase we could not figure out what went wrong or what would have gone wrong. So, I quickly went to a big pharmacy to make some inquires and was told to get 500mg of an antibiotic. I and my husband used it in the evening. We had to continure using it for the next 6 - 8 days so we could notice the effect. Sadly, after 6 days of using it, our conditions became worse and one annoying aspect was that the antibiotics left me with a smelly private part. So, we stopped the self medicatio immediately. We rushed down to the hospital to do some test and found our what was actually worng.
            </p>
            <p>
              After series of test, both of us were diagnosed of Staphylococcus Infection (STAPH). The doctor recommended a highly powered antibiotics for us. We used them as Instructed ... and after the first 3 days the aymptoms reduced, we continued using them straight, until 7 days. After 2 weeks, we did another sets of urethral and vaginal swab test as advised. The test result came out scanty. Just few weeks later on, the symptoms came back very much in our body system! Shy Didn't the Antibiotics work? That was how I started my personal research. The simple truth is, I discovered that infections like staphylococcus, gonorrhea, syphillis, Chlamydia etc. now have resistance to antibiotics. That mean, common highly powered antibiotics will not have much effect on the bacteria and microbes that causes infections.
            </p>
            <p>
              To make it even worse, when you continue using this antibiotics and you are not getting a positive effect from it, you  are putting yourself at an increased risk of getting more infections that resists antibiotic treatment like - MRSA (Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus). While on the Adaeze introduced me to a Consultant. I explained how the staph infection have affected my marriage, destroyed our immune system, affected our health and also affecting my fertility. He recommended this <b>'VANTACIN + CAPSULES'</b> that helped cure the infection.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was naive and skeptical about this because we had used even more expensive products but nothin seemed to work. The Consultant claimed that the product has even helped for other infections like Syphills, Gonorrhea and others.
            </p>
            <p>
              While treating the root cause of the problem and banishes it for life from the body system. According to the health expert, the major difference is that this solution is purely herbal, and gives a permanent cure. Once you complete the herbal treatment, you will not fall into any relapse of the infection recurring anymore! I quickly begged her to help me get the same capsule so I and my husband could use it as well to get rid of infections before it became something else. She agreed and sent it to me.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wanted to be sure the capsule do not have any side effects. You can't blame me though because I have bought several drugs that usually gives some nasty side effects like hadache, stomach pains etc. So, I decided to first giv the product to an old time Pharmacist friend, Charity who worked at a big Pharmacy and Diagnostic centre on the Island. She analyzed the constituents, and found out that it was purely herbal and definitely did not have side effects.
            </p>
            <p>
              immediately,  I and my husband started taking them... After 3 days of using it, we were surprised at the results I got... The brown discharge I usually get before stopped, my mensruation came and the blood was very pure and red. No more itching on my private part again. Fast forward to 5 days later, my husband get morning erections without feeling any pains at all. Also one major difference was that, he no longer feel any burning sensation or pain when urinating. Our urine became much clearer, no more wormlike movement in our entire body. The internal heating has also stopped. We decided to finish the entire product before we went to the hospital for another test. When the results came out... we were grateful to God...
            </p>
            <p>
              My Husband and I tested megative to Staphylococcus and every other infections. Just to confirm, after a few weeks, we went to another Diagnostic Medical centre for the same test, and the results was still negative. To still confirm the results, we decided to give the same remedy to our inner circle of friends and colleagues that have similar issues of Staph infection, STD or urinary tract infections that had discussed the matter with us in private...
            </p>
            <p>
              Likewise, they all came back and were marveled about how the herbal treatment helped flush off infections from their body system, and completely wipes out stubborn infections that are resistant to over-the-counter antibiotic drugs and injections. And the best part of all is that they never felt even a slight headache when using it (no side effects at all). The solution is here, just hang on a bit!
